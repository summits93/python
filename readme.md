Certainly! To encrypt objects in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket using PGP encryption in Python, you can use the `gpg` command-line tool along with the `subprocess` module. Make sure you have GPG installed on your system.

Here's a basic example:

```python
import subprocess
from google.cloud import storage

def encrypt_with_pgp(source_file, encrypted_file, recipient_key):
    # Use GPG to encrypt the file
    subprocess.run(["gpg", "--encrypt", "--recipient", recipient_key, "--output", encrypted_file, source_file])

def upload_encrypted_object(bucket_name, source_file, destination_blob_name):
    # Encrypt the file using PGP
    recipient_key = "recipient@example.com"  # Replace with the PGP recipient's key
    encrypted_file = "path/to/encrypted/file.gpg"
    encrypt_with_pgp(source_file, encrypted_file, recipient_key)

    # Create a Storage client
    storage_client = storage.Client()

    # Get the bucket
    bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)

    # Create a Blob object
    blob = bucket.blob(destination_blob_name)

    # Upload the encrypted file
    blob.upload_from_filename(encrypted_file)

    print(f"Encrypted file {source_file} uploaded to {bucket_name}/{destination_blob_name}.")

# Example usage
bucket_name = "your-gcs-bucket-name"
source_file = "path/to/your/local/file.txt"
destination_blob = "destination/object/file.gpg"

upload_encrypted_object(bucket_name, source_file, destination_blob)
```

Replace `"recipient@example.com"`, `"your-gcs-bucket-name"`, `"path/to/your/local/file.txt"`, and `"destination/object/file.gpg"` with your specific PGP recipient key, GCS bucket name, local file path, and destination object path.

Make sure to handle your PGP keys securely and ensure that the GPG tool is properly configured on your system. Adjust the script based on your specific PGP encryption needs and security considerations.
